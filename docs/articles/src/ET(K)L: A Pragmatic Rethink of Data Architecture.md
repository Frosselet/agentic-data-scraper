ET(K)L: A Pragmatic Rethink of Data Architecture

Data architecture today is an intricate web of frameworks, technologies, and methodologies. We’ve moved from classic ETL pipelines to ELT, from data warehouses to data lakes, and now lakehouses and data meshes. We’ve layered in semantics, governance, lineage, and more.

And yet, in the middle of all this progress, something feels… off.

Despite all the sophistication, the real-world delivery of data systems often remains fragmented. Data pipelines break, ownership is unclear, semantics are lost between tools, and enterprise architecture lives far from the engineering realities on the ground.

This is where I have started to brainstorm around the idea of ET(K)L.

“Let's not reinvent the wheel. Let's ask why it’s still stuck in the mud.”
Not Another Framework. A Shift in Perspective.

ET(K)L is not a new architecture, it inherits every great ideas developed within the last 40 years. It’s not another branded framework or methodology. It’s just a perspective—an opinionated and pragmatic one—on how we can reconnect data architecture with enterprise & business architecture, engineering and execution. 

It builds on what already exists. ET(K)L does not reject ELT, knowledge graphs, or semantic layers. Instead, it asks why these powerful ideas often fall short in practice—and how we might build something more integrated, realistic, and human-aware.

At its heart, ET(K)L is a response to a problem many of us have felt: that business, architecture and engineering are too often treated as separate worlds, and knowledge—real, practical knowledge—is left out of the loop entirely. 

So What Does the (K) Stand For?

The “K” in ET(K)L stands for Knowledge. But not in a vague or academic sense.

It’s not about abstract ontologies or PDFs full of documentation that no one reads. It’s about the kind of knowledge that:

Lives inside brittle SQL queries, undocumented business rules, or as comments/helpers in code.
Sits implicitly in the heads of domain experts and data engineers.
Gets reinvented across teams because it was never made explicit and easily discoverable and shareable.
Knowledge, in this sense, is what connects data to meaning, and engineering to intent. It’s the missing layer that gives context to what we’re building and why.

Too often, we focus on moving data—extract, transform, load—and forget to move the meaning with it. ET(K)L is a call to embed knowledge directly into our workflows, pipelines, models, and systems—not as a separate layer, but as part of the flow itself. Let's also not forget the anchor for data processes: what  is this data useful for, how does it deliver value? What does it represent in our business models?

Why This Matters Now

Organizations today are under pressure to be data-driven, AI-ready, and insight-led. But you can’t automate what you don’t understand. And you can’t scale what you haven’t made explicit.

When architecture is separated from the realities of implementation, when knowledge is siloed or hidden, we end up with systems that look good on paper but don’t deliver in practice.

ET(K)L is a reminder that simplicity, clarity, and integration matter more than buzzwords. It’s about bridging:

Data and semantics.
Architecture and delivery.
Business models and engineering realities.
It’s not about starting from scratch—it’s about reframing how we think about what we’re already doing. This isn’t about prescribing what to do or what to avoid. It’s about challenging the habit of constantly exploring new directions, only to end up circling back to the same unresolved problems. We need to break the loop—not keep reinventing paths that lead us nowhere new.
This Series Is a Conversation, Not a Conclusion

This article is the beginning of a series where I’ll unpack ET(K)L in more depth. I’m not offering a finished solution, but rather a working hypothesis. A trigger to question some assumptions, reconnect ideas, and rethink how we approach the design and delivery of data systems.

In the coming posts, I’ll explore:

What we really mean by “knowledge” in data workflows.
How ET(K)L differs from traditional ETL/ELT in practice.
Where architecture, engineering AND business can meet more effectively.
How to turn these ideas into processes, teams, and outcomes.
As it is a conversation, I am already looking forward to feedback, and at a certain moment, we might eventually start building things collectively involving some coding :)
