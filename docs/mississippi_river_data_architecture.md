#### **Entity Types**
1. **Spatial Entities**
   - WaterwaySegment (river miles, coordinates, depth)
   - Lock (operational status, capacity, delays)
   - Port (facilities, commodity handling, rail/truck connections)
   - Terminal (storage capacity, loading rates)

2. **Temporal Entities**
   - HydrologicalReading (timestamp, gauge height, flow rate)
   - WeatherForecast (prediction period, conditions, impacts)
   - VesselMovement (AIS position updates, speed, heading)
   - MarketPrice (commodity, location, timestamp, price)

3. **Transportation Assets**
   - Vessel (dimensions, cargo capacity, current load)
   - Barge (configuration, commodity type, destination)
   - RailCar (type, capacity, origin/destination)

## 3. Data Integration Pipeline

### 3.1 Extract Phase (E)
```python
# Real-time data collectors
class USGSGaugeCollector:
    def collect_gauge_data(self, station_id: str) -> Dict:
        # Pull real-time water levels and flow rates
        
class AISDataCollector:
    def collect_vessel_positions(self, bbox: BoundingBox) -> List[VesselPosition]:
        # Collect real-time vessel AIS data
        
class MarketDataCollector:
    def collect_grain_prices(self, terminals: List[str]) -> Dict:
        # Pull commodity prices from USDA and CME
```

### 3.2 Transform & Knowledge Phase (TK)
```python
# Semantic enrichment and inference
class SemanticEnricher:
    def enrich_hydrological_data(self, raw_data: Dict) -> RDFGraph:
        # Convert gauge readings to semantic triples
        # Add spatial and temporal context
        # Infer navigation impacts from water levels
        
    def enrich_vessel_data(self, ais_data: VesselPosition) -> RDFGraph:
        # Link vessels to commodities and destinations
        # Calculate ETA based on current conditions
        # Identify potential routing conflicts
        
    def perform_spatial_reasoning(self) -> None:
        # Calculate distances and travel times
        # Identify alternative routes (rail/truck)
        # Assess route feasibility based on conditions
```

### 3.3 Load Phase (L)
```python
# KuzuDB graph database operations
class KuzuNavigationDB:
    def load_semantic_graph(self, rdf_triples: List[Triple]) -> None:
        # Convert RDF to KuzuDB property graph format
        # Maintain temporal versioning of data
        # Create spatial and temporal indices
        
    def execute_navigation_queries(self, query: NavigationQuery) -> Results:
        # Shortest path calculations with constraints
        # Cost optimization across multiple transport modes

  AND r.water_level > r.minimum_depth
WITH path, reduce(cost = 0, rel IN relationships(path) | 
  cost + rel.transport_cost + rel.delay_cost) as total_cost
RETURN path ORDER BY total_cost LIMIT 1

// Identify vessels at risk of delay
