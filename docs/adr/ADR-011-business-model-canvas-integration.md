# ADR-011: Business Model Canvas Integration for ET(K)L Strategy

## Status
**PROPOSED** - Strategic alignment of semantic architecture with business value

## Context

Following the ET(K)L principles outlined in our LinkedIn articles, we need to connect our semantic navigation intelligence directly to business value streams. Current challenges:

```
❌ Current Gaps:
- Technical excellence without explicit business model alignment
- Semantic capabilities disconnected from value proposition
- Missing ROI demonstration for semantic-first architecture
- No clear mapping between technical features and business outcomes

🎯 Vision: Business-Aligned Semantic Architecture
- Every semantic capability mapped to business value
- Clear ROI demonstration for ET(K)L investments
- Strategic decision-making framework for semantic technology
- Executive-level understanding of semantic architecture benefits
```

**Key Insight**: Technical semantic capabilities must be **strategically aligned** with business model components to demonstrate true enterprise value.

## Decision

We will implement **Business Model Canvas Integration** that connects our semantic ET(K)L architecture directly to business strategy:

1. **Value Proposition Mapping** - Semantic capabilities → Customer value
2. **Revenue Stream Analysis** - How semantic intelligence creates revenue
3. **Cost Structure Optimization** - Semantic efficiency → Cost reduction
4. **Key Partnerships** - Semantic data ecosystem collaboration
5. **Strategic Metrics Dashboard** - Business KPIs from semantic architecture
