# ADR-004: Universal Industry 4.0 Semantic SOW Architecture for Cross-Domain Collaboration

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-09-05  
**Authors:** FranÃ§ois Rosselet, Claude (Anthropic)  
**Reviewers:** TBD  
**Implementation Branch:** `adr-4-semantic-sow-data-contracts`

## Context

Traditional data pipeline development suffers from a fundamental disconnect between business requirements and technical implementation across supply chain, financial, and commodities domains. Current Statement of Work (SOW) documents are unstructured text that require extensive manual interpretation, leading to:

1. **Semantic Gap**: Business requirements lose context during translation to technical specifications across diverse industrial sectors
2. **Manual Pipeline Generation**: Developers must manually interpret requirements and write custom code without understanding Industry 4.0 human-machine collaboration patterns
3. **Inconsistent Data Contracts**: Data validation rules are scattered across codebase without central governance or cross-domain integration
4. **Limited Reusability**: Domain knowledge is embedded in code rather than reusable semantic models that work across supply chain, finance, and commodities
5. **Poor Governance**: No systematic way to enforce business rules, compliance, and data quality requirements across multiple regulatory frameworks
6. **Integration Complexity**: Lack of semantic standards prevents integration with knowledge graphs and external ontologies across industry domains

**Expanded Domain Challenges:**

### Supply Chain Operations Complexity
- **Manufacturing Operations**: Electronics, automotive, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods require integrated production, inventory, and quality management systems
- **Retail & E-commerce**: Multi-channel inventory management, fulfillment optimization, and distribution network coordination
- **Logistics Networks**: Multi-modal transportation, warehousing operations, last-mile delivery, and global supply chain visibility
- **Procurement Operations**: Supplier relationship management, sourcing optimization, contract lifecycle management, and ESG compliance

### Financial Services & Trading Integration
- **Capital Markets**: Equities, bonds, derivatives, structured products requiring real-time risk management and regulatory compliance
- **Foreign Exchange**: Spot trading, forwards, options, algorithmic trading with cross-currency risk management
- **Risk Management**: Credit risk, market risk, operational risk, and compliance across multiple jurisdictions and asset classes
- **Digital Assets**: Cryptocurrency trading, tokenization protocols, DeFi integration, and regulatory compliance frameworks

### Commodities Trading Ecosystem
- **Energy Markets**: Oil, gas, electricity, renewables, carbon credits with complex physical delivery and storage requirements
- **Metals Trading**: Precious metals, industrial metals, mining operations with quality specifications and logistics integration
- **Agricultural Commodities**: Grains, livestock, dairy, soft commodities with seasonal patterns and quality variations
- **Chemicals & Specialties**: Petrochemicals, specialty chemicals, fertilizers with technical specifications and regulatory requirements

**Industry 4.0 Human-Machine Collaboration Requirements:**
- **Strategic Decision Authority**: Human oversight for high-stakes decisions involving regulatory compliance, strategic partnerships, and market positioning
- **Operational Decision Automation**: Machine-driven optimization for routine operations, risk monitoring, and process efficiency
- **Collaborative Decision Making**: Combined human expertise and machine analytics for complex scenarios requiring both domain knowledge and computational power
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Unified frameworks that work across supply chain, finance, and commodities while maintaining domain-specific requirements

The shift to autonomous pipeline generation requires a universal architectural approach where SOWs become comprehensive semantic master documents that contain all context needed for AI agents to generate complete, compliant data pipelines while supporting Industry 4.0 human-machine collaboration patterns across all domains.

## Decision

We will implement a **Universal Industry 4.0 Semantic SOW and Data Contract Architecture** that transforms SOWs from unstructured documents into comprehensive JSON-LD semantic specifications supporting cross-domain human-machine collaboration.

## Integration with ADR-005

This semantic SOW architecture provides the foundation for spatio-temporal knowledge graphs:

1. **Spatial-Temporal Extensions**: SOW schema includes hooks for spatial coordinates, temporal dimensions, and seasonality patterns
2. **Geographic Semantic Annotations**: JSON-LD contexts support GeoSPARQL and OWL-Time ontologies
3. **Domain Context Integration**: Business rules can express spatial-temporal constraints and relationships
4. **Knowledge Graph Preparation**: Semantic annotations enable automatic knowledge graph population

## Monitoring and Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- SOW creation time: Target 50% reduction vs traditional documentation
- Pipeline generation success rate: Target 95% autonomous generation from structured SOWs
- Schema validation performance: Sub-100ms for typical SOW documents
- Semantic reasoning query performance: Sub-1s for domain ontology validation

### Developer Experience Metrics
- Time from SOW to working data contract: Target under 1 hour
- IDE integration adoption rates and satisfaction scores
- Code generation accuracy: Target 90% generated code requires no manual modification
- Schema evolution success rates and migration time

### Business Metrics
- Business analyst onboarding time to semantic SOW creation: Target under 2 days
- Domain template reuse rates across projects: Target 80% reuse for similar domains
- Compliance audit preparation time reduction: Target 75% reduction
- Stakeholder satisfaction with requirement capture accuracy: Target 90%+ satisfaction

### Warning Signs
- High schema validation error rates (>10%) indicating poor UX design
- Low adoption rates (<50% after 3 months) suggesting training gaps
- Performance degradation (>2x overhead) from semantic processing
- Complex migration requirements (>1 week effort) indicating schema design issues
