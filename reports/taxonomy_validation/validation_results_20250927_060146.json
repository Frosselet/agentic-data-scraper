Data Assets must maintain business context, semantic meaning, and operational metadata throughout their lifecycle.

Consider implementing data mesh principles with domain-owned data products, standardized data contracts for interoperability, and federated governance balancing autonomy with enterprise consistency. Storage formats should optimize for both analytical queries (columnar formats like Parquet/ORC) and operational access patterns (key-value, document, graph as appropriate)."

Unlike generic business models that treat data as supporting infrastructure, this model positions data assets as primary value drivers and revenue generators. Lambda implementations must consider: (1) Data lineage tracking from ingestion to business value creation, (2) Multi-tenant data governance with role-based access controls, (3) Real-time data quality monitoring with automated alerts, (4) Cross-functional data product lifecycle management, (5) Semantic data discovery through ontology-based cataloging. Implementation requires event-driven architecture supporting both batch and streaming data processing, with data contracts enforcing schema evolution and backward compatibility. Consider serverless data mesh patterns for scalable domain-driven data architecture."
